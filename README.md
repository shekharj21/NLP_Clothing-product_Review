# NLP_Clothing-product_Review

We have a dataset which contains the reviews of various products given by more than 49,000 customers. We used Topic Modeling.Topic modeling is a technique used to discover topics or themes in a collection of text documents. It's helpful for understanding the main subjects discussed in the reviews.We use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a popular topic modeling algorithm, to identify topics in the reviews.The model's performance varies across different classes. It appears that Class 5.0 has the highest precision, recall, and F1-score, indicating that the model is relatively better at classifying this category. On the other hand, Class 0.0 has very low precision, recall, and F1-score, suggesting that the model struggles to accurately predict this class.Overall, the model has an accuracy of 53.41%, which means it correctly predicts the class for approximately 53.41% of the samples. However, it's important to note that the performance can be further improved, especially for classes with low precision and recall. Fine-tuning the model hyperparameters or considering different algorithms may help enhance the performance.
